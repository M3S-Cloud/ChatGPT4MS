This is the repository for our paper titled "ChatGPT for Microservice Development: How far can we go?" submitted to Microservices 2023: https://www.conf-micro.services/2023/.

<p>
Both microservices and generative AI play significant roles in code development, prompting the question of how generative AI can aid in building a microservice-based system. Although \chatgpt{} has been evaluated for structuring microservices and generating code snippets, limited research exists on its ability to fully develop a microservice-based system. This paper aims to evaluate whether \chatgpt{} can construct a complete system with minimal human oversight, using a known development example. To address this objective, we formulated the following research questions: Is it possible to fully build a microservices system  only using ChatGPT? What are the limitations of ChatGPT for building microservice architecture? What manual/human interventions are needed?



To achieve this, we conducted a preliminary investigation by attempting to replicate SockShop\footnote{https://microservices-demo.github.io/}, a demonstration example of microservices systems, through conversation with \chatgpt{}.
The result of this paper will enable a new line of research into the automatic generation of new services or automated software maintenance. 
The remainder of this paper presents related works, the approach adopted for building the system, a research roadmap towards automated generative microservice-based development.

In this repository, we included everything we used for conducting this study including the prompts and list of requirements. 

<h2>Prompts: </h2>
Primary Chat: https://chat.openai.com/share/6eff2634-f79d-4fa6-9f9c-5638b20747e2 <br />
Secondary Chat: https://chat.openai.com/share/03bbe6cc-5e5b-4dfd-a3cf-9b4290d4571a <br />

<br />

<p>The primary chat served as the foundation for the majority of the existing code within the repository. The only exception occurred during the development of the Cart service, where the developer encountered challenges in effectively guiding ChatGPT-4 to generate responses that met the specified requirements. Consequently, the concept arose to initiate a new chat, referred to as the secondary chat, in order to allow ChatGPT-4 to approach the task with a "clear mind." This approach aimed to eliminate any undesired ideas that may have been inadvertently generated during previous prompts, thereby enhancing predictability. 
The approach turned out to be highly effective, as the developer discovered an improvement in utilizing the code generated by the second chat.</p>
