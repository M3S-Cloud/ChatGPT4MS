<p>The primary chat served as the foundation for the majority of the existing code within the repository. The only exception occurred during the development of the Cart service, where the developer encountered challenges in effectively guiding ChatGPT-4 to generate responses that met the specified requirements. Consequently, the concept arose to initiate a new chat, referred to as the secondary chat, in order to allow ChatGPT-4 to approach the task with a "clear mind." This approach aimed to eliminate any undesired ideas that may have been inadvertently generated during previous prompts, thereby enhancing predictability. 
The approach turned out to be highly effective, as the developer discovered an improvement in utilizing the code generated by the second chat.</p>
